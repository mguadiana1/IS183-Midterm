      <h2>Gourmet Coffee & Tea</h2>
      <p>Gourmet Coffee & Tea Company was founded in 2019 by Michael Guadiana with the hopes of competing with other Coffee giants in the industry. Although the company is a brand new company, we hope to quench the thrist of every customer that purchases or product. </p>
      <p>Currently we are located primarily in Fresno, California but we hope to expand our business to other parts of California. Although our focus is on expansion, we do not plan to desert our loyal customers here in the Central Valley who have shown us support.</p>
      <p>In addition to our wide variety of both coffees and teas, Gourmet Coffee & Teas has a wide range of treats and sweets that will meet your demands. Our stores are also retro-fitted with state-of-the-art technology and comfortable seating for customers of all backgrounds. Come check out our great locations and meet our wonderful staff here at Gourmet Cofee & Tea.</p>
